During that time, a company wanted to hire me but I convinced them to hire my company instead (that will send me and only me to that specific project). We never managed to finish the ERP but we developed some software solutions (TPV, DMS, CMS) for small companies. We shifted to body shopping having up to 6 employees that got paid even when the founders didn't. After some years of struggling with a not regular cash flow, I decided to quit and joined one of our customers back then."

I ensure that our 1:1 sessions have a shared agenda, with at least 90% of the topics driven by my team members. If we find ourselves without topics once, we skip the meeting; if it happens twice, I delve deeper to uncover potential issues.\n\nAs a **Team Lead**, I am dedicated to data-driven decision-making and meticulously measure everything to track and demonstrate team performance. Over the years, I have transitioned away from programming, recognizing that the engineers on my team excel in this area.\n\nI am a strong advocate for knowledge sharing within my teams. I believe that everyone has something to teach and learn, and I encourage this exchange of knowledge to happen primarily within the workplace.",
