During that time, a company wanted to hire me but I convinced them to hire my company instead (that will send me and only me to that specific project). We never managed to finish the ERP but we developed some software solutions (TPV, DMS, CMS) for small companies. We shifted to body shopping having up to 6 employees that got paid even when the founders didn't. After some years of struggling with a not regular cash flow, I decided to quit and joined one of our customers back then."
